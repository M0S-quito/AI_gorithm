# AI_gorithm

This repository hosts a simple web-based algorithm visualizer. The static files live in the `docs` directory so GitHub Pages can serve them. A copy is also kept in the original `site` directory. Currently, the project includes a bubble sort visualization built with vanilla JavaScript.

## Running

Open `docs/index.html` (or `site/index.html`) in your browser. Select an algorithm and press **Start** to see the visualization.
